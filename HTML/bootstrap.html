            <h2>Introduction Of  BootStrap</h2>
            <p>Bootstrap was originally developed by Twitter and released as an open-source project in 2011. Since then, it has become one of the most popular front-end frameworks in the world. The framework focuses on making web development faster and easier by offering pre-styled components and a responsive grid system that adjusts layouts to different screen sizes automatically.</p>
        <p>
            
                <h2> Core Concepts of Bootstrap</h2>
                <ol type="a">
                    <li>  The Grid System
                        Bootstrap’s grid system is one of its most powerful features. It uses a 12-column layout that can adapt to different screen sizes, allowing developers to create complex layouts that are responsive and consistent across devices.
                        <ul type="circle">
                            <li>Responsive Breakpoints: Bootstrap defines breakpoints at different screen widths where the layout can change. The breakpoints are:
                                <ul type="circle">
                                    <li>xs (Extra small): <576px</li>
                                    <li>sm (Small): ≥576px</li>
                                    <li>md (Medium): ≥768px</li>
                                    <li>lg (Large): ≥992px</li>
                                    <li>xl (Extra large): ≥1200px</li>
                                    <li>xxl (Extra extra large): ≥1400px</li>
                                </ul>
                            </li>
                            <li>Defining Columns: Columns are defined using classes like .col, .col-sm, .col-md, .col-lg, etc., to specify the number of columns an element should span at different breakpoints.
                                
                                </ul>
        
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                        <li>. Containers
                            Containers are the fundamental building blocks of Bootstrap layouts. They wrap the content and provide a responsive, fixed-width or fluid-width container for the grid system.
                            <ul type="circle">
                                <li>.container: Provides a responsive fixed-width container that changes with the screen size.</li>
                                <li>.container-fluid: Provides a full-width container that spans the entire width of the viewport.</li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>
                        <li>. Responsive Utilities
                            Bootstrap includes utility classes for showing, hiding, or styling elements based on the screen size.
                            
                            </li>
                    </li>
                        
                </ol>
                
                  <hr>
                  <h2>Bootstrap Components</h2>

                    <li> Buttons
                        Bootstrap provides various button styles that can be applied using classes like .btn, .btn-primary, .btn-secondary, .btn-success, etc.</li>
                        <li>. Forms
                            Bootstrap simplifies form styling with various classes to style inputs, labels, and form groups.</li>

                </ol> 
                  </ol><hr>
