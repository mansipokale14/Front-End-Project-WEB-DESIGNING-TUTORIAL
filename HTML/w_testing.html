Web terminology related to testing involves the concepts, tools, and practices used to ensure that websites or web applications function
correctly, are user-friendly, secure, and perform well across different devices and browsers. Here's an overview of key web testing 
terminologies:

1. Functional Testing:
- Unit Testing: Testing individual components or functions of a website to ensure they work as intended. For example, testing a specificform or button.
- Integration Testing: Verifying that different modules or components of the website work together correctly. For instance, that the login system communicates
  properly with the user database.
- System Testing: Testing the complete website as a whole to validate that it meets the specified requirements.
- Regression Testing: Re-running tests after changes (such as updates or bug fixes) to ensure that existing functionality has not been broken.
        
2. Performance Testing:
- Load Testing: Assessing how the website performs under expected user loads, ensuring it can handle traffic without slowing down.
- Stress Testing: Testing the website beyond normal operational capacity to see how it behaves under extreme conditions,such as high traffic spikes.
- Scalability Testing: Ensuring that the website can scale up to accommodate increasing loads, both in terms of users and data.
- Latency Testing: Measuring the time it takes for a request to travel from the client to the server and back, important for optimizingwebsite speed.
        
3. Usability Testing:
- User Interface (UI) Testing: Checking the website's user interface for consistency, accessibility, and ease of use. This involvestesting navigation, layout,
  and design elements.
- A/B Testing: Comparing two versions of a webpage to see which performs better in terms of user engagement and conversion rates.
- User Experience (UX) Testing: Gathering feedback from real users to assess how easy and satisfying the website is to use, identifyingareas for improvement.
        
4. Security Testing:
- Penetration Testing:Simulating attacks on the website to find and fix vulnerabilities before hackers can exploit them.
- Vulnerability Scanning:Automatically scanning the website for known security issues, such as outdated software or misconfiguredsettings.
- Authentication and Authorization Testing: Ensuring that only authorized users can access certain areas of the website and that user credentials are securely
  handled.
        
5. Compatibility Testing:
- Cross-Browser Testing:Ensuring the website works correctly across different web browsers (e.g., Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge) and versions.
- Cross-Platform Testing:Verifying that the website functions as intended on various platforms, including desktops, tablets,and smartphones.
- Responsive Testing: Checking that the website layout adapts well to different screen sizes and orientations.
        
6. Automation Testing:
- Test Automation Tools:Using tools like Selenium, Cypress, or TestCafe to automate repetitive testing tasks, improving efficiencyand consistency.
- Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD):Integrating automated testing into the development pipeline to ensure thatnew code is tested automatically  
  before deployment.
        
7. Accessibility Testing:
- WCAG Compliance:Ensuring the website meets Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG), making it accessible to users with disabilities.
- Screen Reader Testing: Verifying that the website can be effectively used with screen readers and other assistive technologies.
        
8. Beta Testing:
- Beta Release:Releasing a version of the website to a select group of users to identify bugs or issues in a real-world environment before the full launch.
- Feedback Collection:Gathering feedback from beta testers to make necessary adjustments and improvements.
        
9. End-to-End Testing:
- Workflow Testing:Simulating real-world user scenarios to test the website from start to finish, ensuring that all components work together smoothly.
        
10. Test-Driven Development (TDD):
- Red-Green-Refactor:** Writing tests before code, then writing the minimal amount of code to pass the test, and finally refactoring the code while keeping 
  it functional.
        
11. Acceptance Testing:
- User Acceptance Testing (UAT):Testing the website from the end-user perspective to ensure it meets business requirements anduser needs before going live.
        
12. Exploratory Testing:
- Ad-Hoc Testing:Testing without a specific plan or script to identify unexpected issues, relying on the tester’s intuition and experience.
