                <h2>Firewall</h2>
                <img src="./Image/fiewall .png" id="img8">
                <p>A firewall is a crucial component of network security designed to protect systems from unauthorized access
                    and cyber threats. It functions as a barrier between a trusted internal network and an untrusted external
                    network, such as the internet. By monitoring and controlling incoming and outgoing traffic based on
                    predefined security rules, firewalls prevent malicious activity and unauthorized access to sensitive data.
                    They come in various forms, including hardware firewalls, which are physical devices positioned between a
                    network and its external connections, and software firewalls, which are programs installed on individual
                    devices to manage traffic for that specific machine. Additionally, application firewalls focus on protecting
                    specific applications from attacks, while next-generation firewalls offer advanced features such as
                    intrusion prevention and deep packet inspection. Overall, firewalls are essential for safeguarding networks
                    by filtering traffic, enforcing access controls, and providing monitoring and logging capabilities to ensure
                    the security and integrity of digital systems.</p>
