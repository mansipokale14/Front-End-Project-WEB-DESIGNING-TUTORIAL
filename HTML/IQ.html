        smartphones.

        <li> What is the purpose of version control systems like Git? </li>
        - Aimed at understanding the importance of managing and tracking changes in code during the development process.

        <li> What is a REST API, and how is it used in web development? </li>
        - This question evaluates knowledge of REST (Representational State Transfer) and its use in communication
        between client and server.

        <li> Explain the difference between client-side and server-side scripting. </li>
        - This tests the understanding of where code executes and the impact on performance and user experience.

        <li> What are HTTP methods, and what are their purposes?</li>
        - Asking about methods like GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE to assess knowledge of how data is sent and received over
        the web.

        <li>Can you describe what a Single Page Application (SPA) is?</li>
        - This question checks familiarity with SPAs, which provide a fluid, app-like experience by dynamically updating

        a full reload.

        <li> What are cookies, and what are they used for?</li>
        - Evaluates understanding of how cookies store data about users and sessions on the client side.

        <li> What is CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing), and why is it important?</li>
        - This question focuses on understanding security protocols that allow or block requests between different
        domains.

        <li> Explain what SEO (Search Engine Optimization) is and its importance in web development.</li>
        - This question checks the knowledge of techniques used to improve a website’s visibility on search engines.

        <li> What is minification, and why is it important in web development?</li>
        - Tests the understanding of reducing the size of code files (JavaScript, CSS) to improve website performance.
        - Asking about Asynchronous JavaScript and XML to see if the candidate knows how it allows web pages to update
        asynchronously by exchanging data with a server in the background.</li>

        <li> What is the difference between a GET and POST request?</li>
        - This question assesses knowledge of different HTTP methods and when each should be used.

        <li> What are WebSockets, and how do they differ from HTTP?</li>
        - This question checks the understanding of WebSockets, which provide full-duplex communication between client
        and server.

        <li> What is CDN (Content Delivery Network), and why would you use one?</li>
        - Evaluates the knowledge of CDNs, which help reduce latency by distributing content across multiple servers
        worldwide.

        <li> What is the purpose of HTTPS, and how does it differ from HTTP?</li>
        - This assesses understanding of secure communication on the web, emphasizing the importance of encryption and
        data integrity.

        <li> Can you explain the difference between synchronous and asynchronous code?</li>
        - Tests understanding of how code execution is handled, especially in JavaScript, and how it impacts
        performance.

        <li> What is a web framework, and why would you use one?</li>
        - This question checks the knowledge of frameworks (like React, Angular, Django) that simplify web development.

        <li> Explain what versioning is in an API context.</li>
        - This question looks at the importance of managing different versions of an API to maintain backward
        compatibility.

        <li> What is cross-site scripting (XSS), and how can it be prevented?</li>
        - Assesses understanding of security vulnerabilities and how to protect web applications from them.

        <li> What is MVC architecture?</li>
        - Asking about the Model-View-Controller pattern to see if the candidate understands how it separates concerns
        in application design.

        <li>Can you explain what DNS (Domain Name System) is?</li>
        - Tests knowledge of how DNS translates domain names into IP addresses that browsers use to load websites.

        <li> What is the difference between static and dynamic web pages?</li>
        - This question differentiates between pages that are the same every time and those that are generated on the
        fly.

        <li> What are webhooks, and how do they work?</li>
        - Evaluates understanding of server-side callbacks that notify external services when an event occurs.

        <li> What is the purpose of a load balancer?</li>
