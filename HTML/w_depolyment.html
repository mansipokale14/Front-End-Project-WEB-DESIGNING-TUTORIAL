<h2>Key Aspects of Web Terminology Deployment:</h2>

1.Production Environment:
- Production:The live version of the website that users interact with.

2.Staging Environment:
- Staging:A testing area that mirrors the live site, used to catch issues before going live.

3.Development Environment:
- Development:Where developers build and test new features without affecting the live site.

4.Version Control:
- Git:A tool that tracks changes in the code, allowing multiple developers to work together without conflicts.

5.Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD):
- CI:Automatically testing and merging code changes regularly.
- CD:Automatically deploying updates to the live site after they pass all tests.

6.Deployment Methods:
- Manual Deployment:Uploading files and making changes to the live site by hand.
- Automated Deployment:Using scripts or tools to automatically update the live site, reducing errors.
- Blue-Green Deployment:Switching between two identical environments to update the site with no downtime.
- Rolling Deployment:Gradually updating servers one by one to reduce risk.

7.Containerization:
- Docker:Packaging the application into a container that includes everything it needs to run, making it easy to deploy anywhere.

8.Rollback:
- Rollback:Reverting to a previous version of the site if the new update causes problems.

9.Zero Downtime Deployment:
- Zero Downtime:Deploying updates without taking the site offline, so users don’t experience any interruptions.

10.Monitoring and Logging:
- Monitoring:Keeping an eye on the site’s performance after deployment to catch any issues.
- Logging:Recording any errors or important events to help troubleshoot problems.

Web deployment is all about safely and efficiently taking your website from a development phase to a live environment where users can access it. Understanding 
these basic terms helps ensure a smooth and successful launch.
